# Week 1 â€” App Containerization

## Creating Docker files

I created two docker files:
 - [Backend docker file](https://github.com/djaballah/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/main/backend-flask/Dockerfile).
 - [Frontend docker file](https://github.com/djaballah/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/main/frontend-react-js/Dockerfile).

I created the docker-compose file:
 - [Docker compose file](https://github.com/djaballah/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/main/docker-compose.yml).

I was able to run the application with these commands:
```bash
npm install
docker compose up
```

And here is screenshot of the running application

## Implementing notifications

In order to implement notifications, we need to implemend an endpoint api on the backend and a page to lists
the notifications in the frontend. I implemented this in the following steps:
- Adding the notifications endpoint specifications to the openApi file. ([Commit](https://github.com/djaballah/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/commit/be13c0ddded3b14cfac82519ac86dcd088254d51))
- Implementing the notifications endpoint on the backend. ([Commit](https://github.com/djaballah/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/commit/3f19ffc3bc24e66d072fa4f5c4e07660317b428b))
- Implementing the notifications page in the frontend. ([Commit](https://github.com/djaballah/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/commit/b5c435a1bbbc84552711ac2fb566af9d5f2809e6))

And here is screenshot of the notifications page

## Creating DynamoDB local && PostgreSql docker images.

Add the configuration for DynamoDB local && PostgreSql docker images to the project docker compose file. ([Commit](https://github.com/djaballah/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/commit/575ec0838b68ddb89d8ae61e4c0b2134f4c8d370)).

And check that the their docker containers are correctly set up and running.

## Run the dockerfile CMD as an external script

CMD can be used to run external script. I did this by creating two shell scripts that are going to be used with CMD to start the backend and frontend applications.

- Backend start_script.sh

```bash
#!/bin/bash

python3 -m flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=4567
```

- Frontend start_script.sh

```bash
#!/bin/bash

npm start
```

The backend and frontend Docker files have been updated accordingly to run those scripts

- Backend Dockerfile

```
CMD ["/backend-flask/start_script.sh"]
```

- Frontend Dockerfile

```
CMD ["/frontend-react-js/start_script.sh"]
```

This was implemented in these two commits:
- [Commit 1](https://github.com/djaballah/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/commit/dba887f007f4cecb25db2161ea3debe4effa588b)
- [Commit 2](https://github.com/djaballah/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/commit/1635319c6041334dc38d9454a90d891817812bea)
