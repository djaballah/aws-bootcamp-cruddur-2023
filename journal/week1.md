# Week 1 â€” App Containerization

## Creating Docker files

I created two docker files:
 - [Backend docker file](https://github.com/djaballah/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/main/backend-flask/Dockerfile).
 - [Frontend docker file](https://github.com/djaballah/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/main/frontend-react-js/Dockerfile).

I created the docker-compose file:
 - [Docker compose file](https://github.com/djaballah/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/main/docker-compose.yml).

I was able to run the application with these commands:
```bash
npm install
docker compose up
```

And here is screenshot of the running application
